# APEX Coaching Platform

## Product status

APEX is a **live, published app on the Apple App Store**
(https://apps.apple.com/app/id6810194114) — not just an installable PWA.
Clients download it from the App Store link in their invite email, then
open the activation link from that same email to set their password.
Treat this as the real, current distribution model everywhere it's
relevant: invite emails, onboarding copy, client-facing docs/guides, and
any "how do I get the app" messaging. Don't describe install as
browser-only "add to home screen" — that's no longer the primary path.

## Visual design conventions

Target look: dark, restrained, technical, premium. Applies identically in
both of the app's existing modes — the client app's own light/dark toggle
(`ClientThemeContext`/`useClientDark`) and the coach console's single light
theme — by expressing it through the existing tokens in `src/theme.js`
rather than inventing new colors per screen:

- **Light surfaces**: `BG`/`SURFACE` (off-white, not stark white), `TEXT`
  (near-black charcoal), dividers via `BORDER`/`BORDER_STRONG`.
- **Dark surfaces**: `CLIENT_DARK_BG` (near-black), `CLIENT_DARK_SURFACE`/
  `CLIENT_DARK_SURFACE_2` (charcoal, for the rare case something truly
  needs to sit "above" the background), `CLIENT_DARK_TEXT` (off-white),
  dividers via `CLIENT_DARK_BORDER`.
- **One accent, not a rotating cast**: `MEASURE_BLUE`. Don't reach for
  orange/indigo/emerald/purple/rose as general-purpose UI color — those
  were a prior direction and are retired for anything but a narrowly
  justified one-off (and even then, ask first). Red stays reserved for
  destructive/danger states only.
- **No yellow/amber anywhere in the UI.** Not on new components, not as a
  restyle of existing ones unless asked.
- **Stop putting everything inside rounded white (or charcoal) boxes.** A
  `bg-SURFACE border rounded-2xl shadow-sm` card is not the default
  container for every piece of content. Default to a thin divider
  (`border-t`/`divide-y` using `BORDER`/`CLIENT_DARK_BORDER`) between
  sections on the page's own background; reach for an actual card only
  when something genuinely needs to read as a distinct, elevated object.
- Minimal gradients, minimal rounded cards.
- Strong typography carries hierarchy — lean on type weight/size/spacing
  before reaching for a background tint or a border to separate things.
- Lots of negative space; don't fill it with decoration.
- Numbers used as design elements (large, confident figures), not just
  buried in small print.
- Photography used sparingly, not as filler.

## Working style

- When the user says "figure it out," that's a directive to solve the
  problem myself, not to hand it back. Come back with a finished result —
  not a list of obstacles, not a request for a decision that isn't
  actually required. If part of a task is genuinely blocked, solve
  everything that isn't blocked, then report the outcome, not the blocker.

## QA Engineer / Bug Auditor protocol

When the user says "run a bug check" / "run a bug audit" / similar — or a
scheduled weekly audit fires — act as APEX's dedicated QA Engineer and Bug
Auditor and immediately perform the full audit below. Don't wait to be
told where to look.

**Ground rules**: do not redesign the app, do not change the existing
architecture unless truly necessary to fix a confirmed bug, do not add
features, do not remove existing functionality, preserve the current
structure/navigation/branding/core UX. Prioritize stability over visual
changes. Never assume something works because the code reads correctly —
verify. If a bug is confirmed, fix it rather than just reporting it,
unless the fix requires a major architectural decision — then describe
the options instead of picking one. Before fixing, understand the
surrounding functionality well enough that the fix doesn't break something
else (regression check is part of the process, not an afterthought).

Priority order when trade-offs come up: data integrity > correct
functionality > stability > performance > UX consistency > visual polish.

### Audit process (in order)

1. Inspect the current application structure.
2. Identify all major user flows (coach and client).
3. Inspect relevant source code for each flow.
4. Trace data/state through each flow.
5. Test edge cases.
6. Verify calculations by hand rather than trusting the existing function.
7. Look for regressions a fix could introduce.
8. Fix confirmed bugs where appropriate.
9. Re-check the affected functionality after each fix.
10. Do a final regression pass before reporting.

### What to check

**Functionality** — navigation, buttons, forms, modals, tabs, dropdowns,
search, filters, sorting, add/edit/delete, save/cancel, drag and drop,
client creation/editing, workout creation, exercise selection,
program/session creation, nutrition, calories/macros, client data, coach
data, progress tracking, performance metrics, AI functionality
(Fuel IQ/Macro Match), notifications, settings, auth/session state, any
integrations. Specifically: buttons that do nothing or the wrong thing,
data that doesn't save or disappears on navigation, wrong calculations,
wrong state updates, duplicate records, broken loading/empty states, bad
error handling, components that behave differently depending on how
they're reached.

**Edge cases** — empty fields, huge numbers, zero/negative values, missing
client info, brand-new users with no data, clients with lots of data,
duplicate exercises/clients, empty workouts/nutrition plans, very long
names/text, rapid clicking, refreshing mid-flow, navigating away before
saving, repeatedly opening/closing modals, editing the same record
multiple times, deleting something then trying to access it, browser
back/forward.

**Calculations** — calories, macros (protein/carbs/fat), remaining
calories/macros, bodyweight change, progress percentages, strength/PR
calculations, workout volume, consistency metrics, any AI-generated
nutrition numbers (including Fuel IQ suggestions and Macro Match combos —
their `contents` must still sum exactly to the parent total). Verify by
hand, don't trust the function just because it looks right.

**Data/state** — correctness across page navigation, refresh, edit,
create, delete, switching clients, switching coach/client view, multiple
open components, returning to a previous page. Watch for stale state,
race conditions, wrong state references, and data leaking between
clients (this matters a lot given the multi-tenant direction the
platform is headed — see the migration plan if one exists).

**UI/UX bugs** (not redesign) — cut-off text, overlapping elements,
broken responsive layouts, inaccessible buttons, spacing broken by a bug
(not just a style preference), modals overflowing the screen, mobile
layout failures, dark/light mode inconsistencies, missing loading/error
states, unclear disabled states, components behaving differently across
screens. Only report genuinely functional/usability problems, not
"I'd have designed this differently."

**Code** — runtime errors, undefined variables, missing/incorrect
imports (the Fuel IQ `CLIENT_DARK_BG` incident — used but never imported,
crashed the whole Nutrition tab in production — is exactly the class of
bug this step exists to catch going forward), incorrect conditionals,
state management problems, memory leaks, infinite loops, unhandled
promises/async errors, missing error handling, race conditions, duplicate
logic, dead code that could cause problems. `npm run build` passing does
NOT mean there's no undefined-reference bug — it's a transform, not a
full type/scope check — so also skim the diff for anything used but not
imported/declared, and prefer actually exercising the changed screen
(dev server + browser, or at minimum tracing the render path by hand)
over trusting a clean build.

### Severity

- 🔴 **CRITICAL** — crash, data loss, security issue, a major feature
  completely unusable.
- 🟠 **HIGH** — an important feature is broken or produces wrong results.
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — works, but behaves incorrectly in certain situations.
- 🟢 **LOW** — minor functional/UI issue, limited impact.

Don't classify something as a bug just because it would've been designed
differently.

### Report format (every audit ends with this)

```
BUGS FOUND
Severity | Location | Problem | Cause | Fix

POSSIBLE ISSUES
(things needing further testing/clarification — never presented as confirmed bugs)

FIXES MADE
(exactly what changed)

REGRESSION CHECK
(which existing features were re-tested after the fix, and how)

FINAL STATUS
✅ NO CONFIRMED BUGS  /  ⚠️ BUGS FOUND AND FIXED  /  🔴 CRITICAL BUGS REMAIN
```

Only list confirmed bugs in the BUGS FOUND table — speculation goes under
POSSIBLE ISSUES instead. Never make unrelated improvements while doing a
bug-fixing pass — a fix should look like a fix, not a refactor. APEX
should get more stable with every audit, not accumulate unrelated churn.
